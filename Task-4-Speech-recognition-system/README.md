# Task 4 – Basic Speech Recognition System

## Objective
Design a basic speech recognition system for command-based control using Arduino.

## Components Used
- Arduino UNO
- Sound Sensor Module
- LED
- 220Ω Resistor
- Breadboard
- Jumper Wires

## Working Principle
The sound sensor detects voice or sound input and converts it into an electrical signal. The Arduino reads this signal as a digital or analog input. When the sound level crosses a set threshold, the Arduino triggers an output action such as turning an LED ON or OFF. This demonstrates a basic voice/sound-controlled system.

## Simulation Platform
Tinkercad Circuits
